  - title                                 : What is 311?
    description                           : 
      - It's your city's non-emergency line
      - >
        Many cities in the United States use 311 as an alternative to 911 for non-emergencies.
        You can use it to report a range of issues that your city is (or should be) responsible for fixing.
        On 311 Day, we are focusing on mobility issues, for example:
        <ul>
            <li>Crosswalks without ramps, making them inaccessible to wheelchair users</li>
            <li>Broken-up sidewalks, making them difficult for stroller-pushers</li>
            <li>Vehicles parked on sidewalks, making them inaccessible to pedestrians</li>
            <li>Bike lanes with missing flexposts, allowing cars to park in them</li>
        </ul>
  - title                                 : How does 311 Day work?
    description                           : 
      - Find a neighborhood event near your -- or host your own
      - >
        Look at the map above to find a neighborhood event -- a walk, bike ride, or tabling event.
        Meet your route leader at the time listed, and they'll teach you how to use your city's 311 system.
        This may include an app, a website, the <a href="https://dashcam.bike">dashcam.bike One-Tap 311 Reporting</a>, or simply a phone call to 3-1-1.
  - title                                 : Is 311 reporting effective?
    description                           : 
      - Yes! (For many report types.)
      - >
        Not everything will have immediate responses, but in general, cities that use 311 find it to be a useful tool for citizens to communicate with their city government.
        Response times vary by city and by report type.
        Here are some examples of timelines you might see:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Days:</strong> Debris in a bike lane. icy city-owned sidewalks, or broken traffic signals</li>
            <li><strong>Weeks:</strong> Potholes in a bike lane, fallen flexposts, or crumbling <a href="https://www.adasigndepot.com/blogs/news/what-are-all-these-yellow-pads-with-bumps-on-street-corners">truncated domes</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Months or years:</strong> Items that require political willpower or funding, such as vehicles parked in bike lanes (which requires more protected bike lanes), or nonexistent sidewalks.</li>
        </ul>
        All reports can still be useful for the city to hear your voice and understand the problems you encounter getting around your city.

        National 311 Day is a decentralized way for community groups to organize their own events.
        This website and the National 311 Day Map are hosted by <a href="https://dashcam.bike">dashcam.bike</a>.
  - title                                 : What support is provided to hosts?

        <p>
        We'll collect RSVPs on EventBrite and let you know how many attendees have signed up to attend your event.
        We can also help you find the best way to report issues to your city's 311, whether it's an app, a call, or a website.

        For bike rides hosted by a 501(c)(3) organization, we can provide a discount on our footage-stabilizing <a href="https://amzn.to/3QqCVoU">footage-stabilizing phone mount</a>.
        
        <p>
        This will help keep your riders safe while riding: attendees can record their entire ride, then submit 311 reports when it is safe to stop.
        The <a href="https://dashcam.bike">Dashcam for your Bike app</a> will provide a photo and GPS coordinates which can be used to fill out your city's 311 form.
        </p>
        <p> In select cities, the Dashcam app allows in-app one-tap 311 reporting.  </p>
        <p> Email <a href="mailto:hello@dascham.bike">hello@dascham.bike</a> to request discounted phone mounts.</p>

        If approved, we'll add your information to the map above.
        We recommend you advertise the event through your existing channels.
        You can host a walk, bike ride, or tabling event and you are responsible for teaching attendees what to look out for and what to submit to 311.
        We'll collect RSVPs on EventBrite and let you know how many attendees have RSVPd to your event.
