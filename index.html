<p>
On March 11th, join a local blitz to report mobility issues to 311, your city's non-emergency line.
</p>

<p>
National 311 Day is a movement to help cities understand where they need to improve walking, biking, and rolling infrastructure.
Report broken sidewalks, missing curb cuts, cars parked in bike lanes, and more using your city's 311 line.
</p>

Anyone can host an event: just gather a few friends and report the issues that are important to you.
