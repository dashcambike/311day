On March 11th, walk with your neighbors and report mobility issues to 311, your city's non-emergency line.

<h2>What is 311?</h2>
Many cities in the United States use 311 as an alternative to 911 for non-emergencies.
You can use it to report a range of issues that your city is (or should be) responsible for fixing.
On 311 Day, we are focusing on mobility issues, for example:
<ul>
    <li>Crosswalks without ramps, making them inaccessible to wheelchair users</li>
    <li>Broken-up sidewalks, making them difficult for stroller-pushers</li>
    <li>Vehicles parked on sidewalks, making them inaccessible to pedestrians</li>
    <li>Bike lanes with missing flexposts, allowing cars to park in them</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does 3/11 Day work?</h2>
Look at the map above to find a neighborhood walk or bike ride.
Meet your route leader at the time listed, and they'll teach you how to use your city's 311 system.
This may include an app, a website, the <a href="https://dashcam.bike">Dashcam for your Bike One-Tap 311 Reporting</a>, or simply a phone call to 3-1-1.

<h2>Does 311 reporting work?</h2>
Yes! Not everything will have immediate responses, but in general, cities that use 311 find it to be a useful tool for citizens to communicate with their city government.
Response times vary by city and by report type.
Here are some examples of timelines you might see:

<ul>
    <li><strong>A day or so:</strong> Debris in a bike lane. icy city-owned sidewalks, or broken traffic signals</li>
    <li><strong>A week or so:</strong> Potholes in a bike lane, fallen flexposts, or crumbling <a href="https://www.adasigndepot.com/blogs/news/what-are-all-these-yellow-pads-with-bumps-on-street-corners">truncated domes</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Months or years:</strong> Items that require political willpower or funding, such as vehicles parked in bike lanes (which requires more protected bike lanes), or nonexistent sidewalks.</li>
</ul>
All reports can still be useful for the city to hear your voice and understand the problems you encounter getting around your city.

<h2>Who is running 311 day?</h2>
You are!
National 311 Day is a decentralized way for community groups to organize their own events.
This website and the National 311 Day Map are hosted by <a href="https://dashcam.bike">Dashcam for your Bike</a>, which simplifies the 311 reporting process for bicycle commuters.

<h2>How can I host an event?</h2>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QTIbvoSKYTjw1BzTguUUmqkuDJxff0fcmxYqatvvUVM/edit">Fill out our form</a>.
If approved, we'll add your information to the map above.
We recommend you advertise the event through your existing channels.
You can host either a walk or a bike ride, and you are responsible for teaching attendees what to look out for and what to submit to 311.
